            <h2>At least I'm certainly not <br> & that's why I need your help</h2>

            <p>Whilst this project is a hobby, I still want it to be flawless. I'm way to stupid to achieve this by myself, which is why I would love to hear about mistakes, bugs and other stuff you encounter whilst using my little page.</p>

            <p>I like music. I like playing instruments and composing my own little songs. Over the time I had gathered some knowledge regarding music theory. But – big but(t) – I do not know a lot of stuff. I do not understand a lot of stuff. If you happen
                to find musical mistakes, feel free to hit me up. I'm more than willing to learn stuff, do not heistate to lecture me.</p>

            <p>At the time of the release of this website (March 2022) I have been coding for around two months. Whilst this amount of time may be enough for some to master this craft, it surely wasn't for me. I still make a ton of mistakes – and that's
                okay. I've debugged my code a lot of times, but it's probably still pretty broken. If you encounter any bugs or stuff that seems weird, let me know!</p>

            <p>Feel free to write me an E-Mail with reports of mistakes you have found. <br> Just click on my adress: <a href="mailto:niklasniggemann@yahoo.de">niklasniggemann@yahoo.de</a>!</p>
